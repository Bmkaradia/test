The Isbel<sup>™</sup> Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>End User License Agreement.</strong>  Your use of any mobile application or other downloadable software we may provide (each, an “App”) is subject to an End User License Agreement.  The applicable End User License Agreement depends on the platform on which the App is designed to run and the features of the App.  The End User License Agreement will be presented to you when you download and/or install the App and will be accessible through the App.  Apps are deemed part of the Service, and all such End User License Agreements are hereby incorporated into, and made a part of, the Terms by reference.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Terms.</strong>  Your use of the Service is subject to any additional terms, rules, or guidelines applicable to certain services and features which we may post from time to time (the "Additional Terms").  All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, the Terms.</p>

<p><strong>3. Modification of the Terms</strong><br/>.  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the Terms on a going forward basis at any time.  Please check the Terms periodically for changes.  Your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.  In the event that a change to the Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make an effort to notify you of the change, such as by sending you an email to the address we have on file for you, or presenting a pop-up window or other notification to you through the Service when you log in.  Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication, and material changes will be effective upon the earlier of (a) continued use of the Service with actual knowledge of the modification, or (b) thirty (30) days following the change.  For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising hereunder will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.</p>  
<p><strong>4. Accounts and Registration.</strong><br/>  To access most features of the Service you must register for an account.

If you violate the terms of this Agreement, Isbel<sup>™</sup> reserves the right to reclaim any username you have registered. </p>

You agree to pay to Isbel<sup>™</sup> all fees for such goods or services purchased by you or on your behalf, including in each case any applicable taxes. </p>
<p><strong>Payment.</strong> Isbel<sup>™</sup> will bill charges through the payment method specified in your account or at the time of purchase (e.g. electronic funds transfer or credit card).  If you elect to pay any applicable fees with a credit card, Isbel<sup>™</sup> may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such credit card account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize Isbel<sup>™</sup> to charge all sums described herein to such credit card account. </p>
<p><strong>6. Third Party Services and Websites.</strong><br/> Isbel<sup>™</sup> may provide tools through the Service that link your account on Isbel<sup>™</sup> with an account on the third party service, such as Facebook.  Such third party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the contents of the third party service or the use of your User Content or information by the third party service.  The Service, including our websites, may also contain links to third-party websites.  The linked sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site.  We provide these links as a convenience only, and a link does not imply our endorsement of, sponsorship of, or affiliation with the linked site.  You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any of these third parties services or websites.</p>
<p><strong>7. User Content. </strong></p> 
<p><strong>User Content Generally.</strong>  Certain features of the Service may permit users to post content, including messages, photos, video, data, text, and other types of works (collectively called, “User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Service. </p>

You retain copyright and any other proprietary rights you hold in the User Content that you post to the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Limited License Grant to Other Users.</strong>  By posting and sharing User Content with another user of the Service, you hereby grant that user a non-exclusive license to access and use such User Content.</p>

<p><strong>User Content Representations and Warranties.</strong>  You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing User Content.  By posting and publishing User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that: </p>

<ul>
<li>You are the creator and owner of, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and to authorize Isbel<sup>™</sup> and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section 5 and in the manner contemplated by Isbel<sup>™</sup> and the Terms; </li>

<li>Your User Content, and the use thereof as contemplated herein, does not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (b) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; (c) contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other malicious code; or (d) violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>

You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Isbel<sup>™</sup> with respect thereto.

If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to the Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice.

<p><strong>11. Ownership; Proprietary Rights.</strong><br/>  The Service is owned and operated by Isbel<sup>™</sup>.  The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service provided by Isbel<sup>™</sup> (the “Materials”) are protected by United States copyright, trade dress, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws.  Except for any User Content that is provided and owned by users of the Service, all Materials contained in the Service are the property of Isbel<sup>™</sup> or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and/or third-party licensors.  All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to Isbel<sup>™</sup> or its affiliates and/or third-party licensors.  Except as expressly authorized by Isbel<sup>™</sup>, you agree not to sell, license, distribute, copy, modify, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish, edit, adapt, create derivative works from, or otherwise make unauthorized use of the Materials. Isbel<sup>™</sup> reserves all rights to the Materials not expressly granted in the Terms.</p>

<p><strong>12. Indemnity.</strong><br/>  You agree that you will be personally responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Isbel<sup>™</sup> and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the "Isbel<sup>™</sup> Entities") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of or alleged use of the Service; (ii) your violation of the Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party.  We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>

<p>13. Disclaimers; No Warranties.
The Service is provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis, without warranty or condition of any kind, either expressed or implied.  The Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities specifically (but without limitation) disclaim (i) any implied warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment or non-infringement; (ii) any warranties arising out of course-of-dealing, usage, or trade; (iii) any warranties that the information or results provided in, or that may be obtained from use of, the Service will meet your requirements or be accurate, reliable, complete, or up-to-date; and (iv) any warranties whatsoever regarding any products, services, information or other material advertised, made available, or referred to you through the service.  You assume all risk for all damages, including damage to your computer system, mobile device or loss of data that may result from your use of or access to the Service. Any content, materials, information or software downloaded, used or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk. </p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties in some circumstances.  Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>14. Limitation of Liability.</strong><br/>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities nor any other party involved in creating, producing, operating or delivering the service will be liable for any incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute or any other legal theory, whether or not the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities have been informed of the possibility of such damage where such damages result from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service. You specifically acknowledge that the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities have been informed of the possibility of such damage where such damages result from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service.  You specifically acknowledge that the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities are not liable for the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you.  Further, the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities will have no liability to you or to any third party for any third-party content uploaded onto or downloaded from the site or through the Service.</p>
<p>You agree that the aggregate liability of the Isbel<sup>™</sup> entities to you for any and all claims arising from or related to the use of the Service is limited to the greater of (i) the amounts you have paid to Isbel<sup>™</sup> for access to and use of the Service giving rise to such liability in the twelve (12) months prior to the claim or (ii) $100. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Isbel<sup>™</sup> and you.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability in certain circumstances. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </strong></p>
<p><strong>Generally. </strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms.  <strong>You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong>  Notwithstanding subsection (15.1, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. </p>
<p><strong>Arbitrator.</strong>  Any arbitration between you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Isbel<sup>™</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Notice; Process.</strong>  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, we may send notice to you by electronic mail ("Notice").  Isbel<sup>™</sup> 's address for Notice is: [ISBEL<sup>™</sup> , INC., 156 2nd St, San Francisco, CA, 94105].  The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").  We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Isbel<sup>™</sup> may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Isbel<sup>™</sup> shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Isbel<sup>™</sup> shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Isbel<sup>™</sup> in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.</p>
<p><strong>Fees. </strong> In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Isbel<sup>™</sup> will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  In such case, you agree to reimburse Isbel<sup>™</sup> for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>

<p><strong>No class actions.</strong>  You and Isbel<sup>™</sup> agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purposed class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Modifications.</strong>  In the event that Isbel<sup>™</sup> makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Isbel<sup>™</sup>'s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Isbel<sup>™</sup>'s address for Notice, in which case your account with Isbel<sup>™</sup> shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p>

<p><strong>Enforceability.</strong>  If only Subsection 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>16. Governing Law; Venue.</strong><br/>  These Terms, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California by California residents, and without regard to conflict of law principles.  To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.  We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representations that information and materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Access to the Service from any territory where the content is illegal is prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>17. General.</strong><br/>  The Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Isbel<sup>™</sup> regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.  You may not assign or transfer the Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.  We may assign the Terms at any time without notice.  The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
